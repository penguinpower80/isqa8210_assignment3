#Tech Tracker
This project will be a technical support dispatch and logging system.  Users will be able to visit the page, login, and submit a request for support.  A dispatcher will see the request and assign it to a particular technician for a particular time slot.  The user requesting support will be notified via email, and the technician will be notified via the mobile friendly interface. When the technician arrives on site, they will use the interface to start the job, make notes, and request any parts to be ordered.  They will then schedule a new time slot if they must return, or mark the job as finished.  The user will get an automatic invoice when the job is finished, and the dispatcher can pull a report of billed jobs, parts to order and other system information.
