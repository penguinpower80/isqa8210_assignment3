#Tech Tracker
This project will be a technical support dispatch and logging system.  Users will be able to visit the page, login, and submit a request for support.  A dispatcher will see the request and assign it to a particular technician for a particular time slot.  The user requesting support will be notified via email, and the technician will be notified via the mobile friendly interface. When the technician arrives on site, they will use the interface to start the job, make notes, and request any parts to be ordered.  They will then schedule a new time slot if they must return, or mark the job as finished.  The user will get an automatic invoice when the job is finished, and the dispatcher can pull a report of billed jobs, parts to order and other system information. 

## Setting up
- Clone the repo from GitHub
  - Make sure your product has a valid venv set up for python 3.8 or later.
- install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- copy or rename the file called `env.sample` to `.env`
  - DO NOT INCLUDE THIS FILE IN YOUR COMMIT (it is in the gitignore file already)
  - Add the appropriate settings values:
    - SECRET_KEY
      - You can leave as is for testing, but if deploying, you can generate a new key here: https://miniwebtool.com/django-secret-key-generator/
    - DB
      - The database type you want to use.  Leave at `sqlite` for testing, but can change to `MYSQL` if you want to connect to a mysql database.
    - DB_NAME
      - Name of the database.  Leave at `db.sqlite3` for testing
    - DB_HOST
      - Hostname of the database server.  Leave blank for your local machine (127.0.0.1)
    - DB_USER
      - Username with read/write permission to the database
    - DB_PASSWORD
      - Password to use when connecting to the database
    - DB_PORT
      - TCP/IP Port to use to connect to the server.  Default MYSQL port is 3306
    - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
      - The access key id for your AWS S3 bucket
    - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
      - The access key secret for your AWS S3 bucket
    - AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME
      - The AWS S3 bucket name
    - EMAIL
      - Set to 'LOCAL' for local storage in a directory
      - Set to 'SENDGRID' to use SENDGRID
    - EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD
      - If using SENDGRID, the password (API Key)
      - https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys
    - EMAIL_HOST_USER
      - If using SENDGRID, the username (defaults to 'apikey')
    - FROM
      - Default FROM email address for SENDGRID
    - \#FORCED_INVOICE_EMAIL
      - If you are testing, then remove the # and set a valid email.
      - All invoice emails will be force sent to that email address, overwriting customer email address
      - Will also overwrite the email if using the CLI option
    - HEROKU
      - If this system running in a Heroku environment, set to 'True'
      - Mostly prepares the settings file for including Heroku specific items.

  - If use S3, you can follow these steps to setup the AWS Bucket:
    - https://blog.theodo.com/2019/07/aws-s3-upload-django/
  - These environment files typically have a way to be provided by a hosting system.
    - In Heroku, open your app dashboard and then navigate to Settings and add an entry for each item necessary under Config Vars
    - Make sure the "HEROKU" config var is set to "True"
- 

### Initial Setup
*DO THIS ONLY ONCE AT THE VERY BEGINNING OR TO START OVER!!*
- In the terminal, run `python manage setup` 
  - This will:
    1. Erase any migrations
    2. Make the migrations fresh
    3. Delete the SQLITE db if found (it will NOT delete a MYSQL database.  You must reset this manually if you want to start over and are using a MySQL database)
    4. Populate the WorkingDay, PayRate, Skills tables and add some dummy parts
    5. It will run db seeding operation to create techs and users.  Follow the on-screen prompts
    6. Prompt to create a new superuser



### Keep existing DB
- If you want to not seed the db and keep any existing data, you can just run:
  - `python manage.py makemigrations && python manage.py migrate`
  - `python manage.py initial_entities` (if you want the basic info (WorkingDay, PayRate, Skills, and dummy parts) populated)
  - `python manage.py createsuperuser` (if you want a superuser created)

### Run Server
- After running either the initial setup or other setup routines run:
  - `python manage.py runserver`
  
### Send Invoice from CLI
- An invoice will be sent when a job is set to complete, but you can send from the command line by running:
  - `python manage.py sendinvoice <jobid> [email]`
    - `jobid` must be a valid job ID integer
    - `email` lets you optionally overwrite the customer email.  If `FORCED_INVOICE_EMAIL` is set in environment, then this will not take effect.
